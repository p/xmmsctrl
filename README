This is a small utility to control xmms from
the command line or a shell. The interest
comes with key bindings in a window manager.
I give my key bindings for twm to show how
to program some keys. I'm using a small script
window_shown to test the state of windows.

xmmsctrl without argument will print a summary
of commands. They are pretty straight forward.
The file twmrc_bindings contains examples on
how to use test commands.

The samples directory contains sample scripts
to illustrate how to use xmmsctrl.

To compile: make
To install: make install
